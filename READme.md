# Smart Chandelier - SW development project

## Introduction

This is the team project of KAIST CS350(Introduction to Software Engineering). Goal of this project is to develop the software-intensive IoT system that incorporates at least one sensor and utilize data collected from it.

### What is Smart Chandelier?

With the development of IoT technology, a house is being reborn as a smart residential space that provides suitable services to residents beyond the meaning of space. The door-lock recognizes the user's location and opens the door remotely without going in front of it, the smart plug determines waste/standby power to reduce the electricity bill, and the voice recognition technology makes it possible to use IoT devices with voice from a distance. To further accelerate this change, we present an innovative lighting system with IoT technology. We selected a lighting system because it would be most efficient to provide additional services and environments to users through the sense of sight, which is the most sensitive of the five senses and collects the most information. In addition, interest in space design has recently increased, and the trend of using interior lighting in various ways to make the space stand out is spreading. Even in the same space with the same furniture arrangement, different atmospheres can be created depending on the lighting, so interior lighting has a great influence not only on practicality but also on the mood and comfort of living and working spaces.

However, it is not easy to change the installed lighting every time just to change the atmosphere. In addition, lighting is greatly influenced by various factors such as location, direction, intensity, and color as well as lamp design, so there is a limit to existing products in designing lighting suitable for various situations. Therefore, we intend to provide appropriate lighting based on the user's situation and surrounding environment data through the 'Smart Chandelier', and to satisfy the users' needs.
